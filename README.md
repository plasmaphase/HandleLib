# Handle Based Library Example

## Background

This is a simple library which demonstrates a handle based design.

### Summary

Handle based libraries allow the consumer to have multiple instances of a library active simultaneously with only a single set of functions.
This simple demo library shows how multiple instances are used, how the contents of the handle are hidden using initialization parameters,
and how accessor functions can be used to allow the user access to crucial parameters/data.
